And the minimum numbers of missing value for a row is 0. Since the mean of numbers of missing value is 2.274, we can find that the most rows who have the numbers of missing value are less or equal to 5. Second, we describe missing patterns by column, and from the result we can see that BOROUGH, Name, NEIGHBORHOOD, BUILDING_CLASS_CATEGORY, TAX_CLASS_AT_TIME_OF_SALE, BUILDING_CLASS_AT_TIME_OF_SALE, SALE_PRICE and SALE_DATE do not have missing value. We conclude that there are total 6 missing variables. Last, from the table above we know that there are 8 variables with 0 missings, comprising 57.14% of variables in the data set. There is 1 variable with 5302 missings.There is 1 variable with 18837 missings. 4.2 Exploring the Missing Values The above graph provides a summary of whether the data is missing or not. It also provides the amount of missings in each columns. So here, LAND_SQUARE_FEET and GROSS_SQUARE_FEET have the most missing data, with LAND_SQUARE_FEET having 55.93% missing data and GROSS_SQUARE_FEET have 55.93%. We also try to add facets in above plots with different Borough. ## [1] 163906 These four graphs show that the information on the missing value of the data set. There are 163906 values missing in it. Since there are 72067 rows in the data set, we choose to do graphs visualization every 20,000 rows. 4.3 Excluding Missing Values from Analyses When dealing with data that is missing at random, related data can be deleted to reduce bias. We delete the columns with missing values above 20,000 and then drop the missing values. After removing rows with missing values, we get: ## [1] &quot;BOROUGH&quot; &quot;Name&quot; ## [3] &quot;NEIGHBORHOOD&quot; &quot;BUILDING_CLASS_CATEGORY&quot; ## [5] &quot;TOTAL_UNITS&quot; &quot;YEAR_BUILT&quot; ## [7] &quot;TAX_CLASS_AT_TIME_OF_SALE&quot; &quot;BUILDING_CLASS_AT_TIME_OF_SALE&quot; ## [9] &quot;SALE_PRICE&quot; &quot;SALE_DATE&quot; ## tibble [48,156 × 10] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ BOROUGH : chr [1:48156] &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; ... ## $ Name : chr [1:48156] &quot;Manhattan&quot; &quot;Manhattan&quot; &quot;Manhattan&quot; &quot;Manhattan&quot; ... ## $ NEIGHBORHOOD : chr [1:48156] &quot;ALPHABET CITY&quot; &quot;ALPHABET CITY&quot; &quot;ALPHABET CITY&quot; &quot;ALPHABET CITY&quot; ... ## $ BUILDING_CLASS_CATEGORY : chr [1:48156] &quot;02 TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS&quot; &quot;07 RENTALS - WALKUP APARTMENTS&quot; &quot;07 RENTALS - WALKUP APARTMENTS&quot; &quot;07 RENTALS - WALKUP APARTMENTS&quot; ... ## $ TOTAL_UNITS : num [1:48156] 2 20 29 10 30 8 10 9 10 10 ... ## $ YEAR_BUILT : num [1:48156] 2003 1900 1910 1910 1900 ... ## $ TAX_CLASS_AT_TIME_OF_SALE : chr [1:48156] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;2&quot; ... ## $ BUILDING_CLASS_AT_TIME_OF_SALE: chr [1:48156] &quot;B1&quot; &quot;C4&quot; &quot;C1&quot; &quot;C4&quot; ... ## $ SALE_PRICE : num [1:48156] 3025000 154196 7500000 5650000 11600000 ... ## $ SALE_DATE : POSIXct[1:48156], format: &quot;2021-12-16&quot; &quot;2021-06-11&quot; &quot;2021-06-14&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;na.action&quot;)= &#39;omit&#39; Named int [1:23911] 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:23911] &quot;17&quot; &quot;18&quot; &quot;19&quot; &quot;20&quot; ... ## # A tibble: 6 × 10 ## BOROUGH Name NEIGHBORHOOD BUILDING_CLASS_CATEGORY TOTAL_UNITS YEAR_BUILT TAX_CLASS_AT_TI… ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Manhattan ALPHABET CITY 02 TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS 2 2003 1 ## 2 1 Manhattan ALPHABET CITY 07 RENTALS - WALKUP APART… 20 1900 2 ## 3 1 Manhattan ALPHABET CITY 07 RENTALS - WALKUP APART… 29 1910 2 ## 4 1 Manhattan ALPHABET CITY 07 RENTALS - WALKUP APART… 10 1910 2 ## 5 1 Manhattan ALPHABET CITY 07 RENTALS - WALKUP APART… 30 1900 2 ## 6 1 Manhattan ALPHABET CITY 07 RENTALS - WALKUP APART… 8 1900 2 ## # … with 3 more variables: BUILDING_CLASS_AT_TIME_OF_SALE &lt;chr&gt;, SALE_PRICE &lt;dbl&gt;, SALE_DATE &lt;dttm&gt; "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Analysis from the perspective of the five Boroughs 5.2 Analysis House Price from the Perspective of Tax Class", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Analysis from the perspective of the five Boroughs First, we made an initial breakdown of the sales prices of homes sold on a rolling basis over the past year, dividing home transactions into five sections based on boroughs: ‘Manhattan’, ‘Bronx’, ‘Brooklyn’, ‘Queens’, and ‘StatenIsland’. From the pie chart we can see that in the past year, Brooklyn had the highest rolling home sales (15,037), followed by Queens (14,436). The bronx, on the other hand, had the lowest number of home sales at 3573.Manhattan and Staten Island are in the middle. Our initial speculation is because most people’s jobs may be in or near Manhattan, but the prices in Manhattan and the cost of living are so high that they choose to settle closer to it. And compared to bronx and Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens are better places to live, such as buying goods or transportation will be more convenient. 5.1.1 Visualize Distributions of Building Year Built with Different Borough The left is the Boxplots of Year of Building Establishment by Borough Name. The right graph is the Ridgeline Plots of Year of Building Establishment by Borough Name. The boxplots allow us to see that there are some year bulit outliers for each borough, with the most happening in the “StatenIsland” borough. We can also see from the boxplots that the median year built is similar for Bronx and Brooklyn. The ridgeline plots allow us to easily compare distributions of the year built of collisions. The distribution of year built for Queens, Brooklyn, and Bronx are all very similar and basically trimodal about 1925, with some collisions happening at later years. The distribution of year built at StatenIsland is little different – it is almost unimodal with modes at 1985. We have examined the changes in house prices over time in different regions during the year: Meanwhile, we can see that between April 2021 and the end of 2021, the rolling house price prices in all four regions except the bronx are on a relatively low trend. And by January 2022, there is a significant upward trend in house prices. In our opinion, this is related to the economic downturn and lower home prices due to covid-19 last year. And by January of this year, the pandemic’s impact on the economy is significantly lower, and the real estate market is showing signs of recovery. Based on our previous general knowledge of these five areas, we wanted to visualize the relationship between neighborhoods and house prices in these five areas, so we drew a tree diagram by comparing the sales prices of different neighborhoods under different boroughs. We can see that in Manhattan’s neighborhoods, the upper west side, midtown west and clinton areas all have relatively high housing prices. For Brooklyn, the house in bedford stuyvesant and crown heights areas are more sought after. And people in Queens prefer to settle in Flushing and Long Island.And people in Queens prefer to settle in Flushing and Long Island. Our analysis is because most Chinese people are active in Flushing, while Long Island is close to Manhattan and not as expensive as Manhattan. That’s why houses in these two areas are more popular. 5.2 Analysis House Price from the Perspective of Tax Class Next, we further investigate rolling house prices from the perspective of tax levels. In our dataset, taxes are divided into four levels. Class I:Includes most residential properties of up to three units (e.g: Two- and three-family dwellings and one- or two-family apartments attached to a small store or office), vacant land zoned for residential use, and most apartments of no more than three stories. Class 2: Includes all other properties that are primarily residential, such as cooperatives and condominiums. Class 3:Includes property companies that own gas, telephone or electric equipment. Class 4:Includes all other properties not included in Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3, such as offices, factories, warehouses, garages, etc. ## ## 2021 2022 ## 38186 9970 We also compared the rolling transaction prices between the different tpyes of houses in tax category 1, 2 and 4: From this chart, we can see that the fourth type of tax area has the most housing types. Office bulidings and warehouses for it are the most expensive types of houses. On the contrary, condo and outdour facilities are considered to have lower transaction prices in the fourth tax category. Among these threetypes, the average price of the first tax type is less compared to the other two, and the house type is also the least. We consider the reason for this phenomenon is that in a rapidly growing economy, most people choose to live in condominiums rather than up to three units below the third floor, so the first tax type has been gradually eliminated from the rolling housing market. In addition to home prices, we also wanted to understand the relationship between the total number of units at the listed property and the type of housing and taxes. Therefore, we drew a treemap: Unlike the relationship between taxes and house prices mentioned earlier, properties in the second tax category have more number of units, and special condo billing lots are the most prominent in the second category. Moreover, the fourth tax type has the least number of units, which is the opposite of its relatively high price. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component We also create two interactive graphs that give users a new understanding of the data set and a clear understanding of the purpose of the visualization. The above graph shows the interactive scatter plot of the year of construction (the older the year, the older the house) and the house price in different borough. From the graph, we can draw the following points: the older the year of construction, the higher the house prices, especially in Brooklyn and Manhattan. However, it is worth noting that the housing prices in Queens and Bronx were higher before 1950. Next, StatenIsland with the cheapest housing prices, and Manhattan with the most expensive housing prices. Overall, house prices in the five boroughs are similar in Manhattan and Brooklyn, where Bronx and Queens are similar. The age of the house has an impact on the price of the house in a certain sense. The second graph shows above is the interaction between the number of housing sold in different boroughs. We can zoom in and see that in the Bronx, for example, there are 5 neighborhoods with over 200, from highest to lowest is: Soundwiew(277), Throgs Neck(267), Williamsbridge(245), Baychester(235), Morris Park(216). The highest number of of housing sold in Brooklyn is Bedford Stuyversant(1135), the highest number of of housing sold in Manhattan is Harlem-Central(595), the highest number of housing sold in Queens is Flushing-North(1626), and the highest number of housing sold in StatenIsland is Great Kills(621). Overall, Queens and Brooklyn have more number of housing sold compared to the other three boroughs, Manhattan has a similar number of housing sold with StatenIsland, and the Bronx has the lowest number of housing sold.
